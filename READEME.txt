How to use the json:
output_file : use any output name you'd like and it will create "file_name.xslx"
input_file : name of file you're using, include the xslx file extension
rain_threshold : float used to represent minimum amount of avg precipitation for a day to be considered rainy (used for days since last rain)

.env Use:
a .env is used to store secrets, so do not publish the .env anywhere. It contains the API_key for meteostat

Notes
------------------------------
I calculated average humidity, but as a measurement apparently it sucks so do with that what you will
https://www.campbellsci.com/blog/averaging-relative-humidity
I considered it a rainfall day if the avg preciption was above 0.0 mm of rain to be a day of rain, this can be changed in settings.json under "rain_threshold" 
I used "NA" for days since last rain if there was none prior in the +-7 day range for each day 
The API key is good for 500 requests a month on the free version. Each usage of this script makes the number of rows of requests.
