How to use settings.json:
output_file : use any output name you'd like and it will create "file_name.xslx"
input_file : name of file you're using, include the xslx file extension
rain_threshold : float used to represent minimum amount of avg precipitation for a day to be considered rainy (used for days since last rain)

.env Use:
a .env is used to store secrets, so do not publish the .env anywhere. It contains the API_key for meteostat

requirements.txt:
This is used to download the neccesary packages for the script
    How to:
    # create a virtual environment so the packages are not installed globally
    python -m venv venv 
    # activate the virtual environment. This is how you do it on windows, its different on different machines.
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # recursively install the packages in requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Updates to the script will be reflected in the github repository:

Misc Notes
------------------------------
I calculated average humidity, but as a measurement it isn't very accurate so do with that what you will
https://www.campbellsci.com/blog/averaging-relative-humidity
I considered it a rainfall day if the avg preciption was above 0.4 mm of rain to be a day of rain, this can be changed in settings.json under "rain_threshold" 
I used "NA" for days since last rain if there was none prior in the +-7 day range for each day 
The API key is good for 500 requests a month on the free version. Each usage of this script makes the number of rows of requests.

The script is also slow due to request per second limits
